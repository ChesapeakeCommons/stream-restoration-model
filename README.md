# Stream Restoration Model (Protocols 1 - 5)

FieldDoc integrates a mathemetical model for crediting stream restoration practices implemented for the Chesapeake Bay TMDL. This model estimates nutrient and sediment load reductions using data and algorithms from the [2019/2020 Stream Restoration Expert Panel Report](https://chesapeakestormwater.net/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2021/10/Unified-Stream-Restoration-Guide_FINAL_9.17.21.pdf).

There are currently five protocols that define the nutrient and sediment removal rates associated with stream restoration practices.

The source code for this application contains separate modules for each of the five protocols. Read [the wiki](https://github.com/ChesapeakeCommons/stream-restoration-model/wiki) for full implementation details.

## Modules

* [Protocol 1: Prevented sediment](https://github.com/ChesapeakeCommons/stream-restoration-model/wiki/Protocol-1:-Prevented-sediment)
* [Protocol 2: Hyporheic exchange](https://github.com/ChesapeakeCommons/stream-restoration-model/wiki/Protocol-2:-Hyporheic-exchange)
* [Protocol 3: Floodplain reconnection](https://github.com/ChesapeakeCommons/stream-restoration-model/wiki/Protocol-3:-Floodplain-reconnection)
* [Protocol 4: Stormwater performance standard](https://github.com/ChesapeakeCommons/stream-restoration-model/wiki/Protocol-4:-Stormwater-performance-standard)
* [Protocol 5: Outfall and gully stabilization](https://github.com/ChesapeakeCommons/stream-restoration-model/wiki/Protocol-5:-Outfall-and-gully-stabilization)
